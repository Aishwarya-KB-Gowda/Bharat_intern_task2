**Project Name:** Simple Netflix-Inspired Homepage

**Description:**

This project replicates a basic layout similar to the Netflix homepage using HTML and CSS. It aims to provide a starting point for learning web development fundamentals like structure, styling, and potentially responsiveness.

**Features:**

- **Basic Layout:** Mimics the Netflix homepage structure, including sections for:
    - A logo or banner
    - A search bar (non-functional)
    - Featured content sections
    - User profile and navigation elements (non-functional)
- **Simplified Styling:** Adopts a color scheme and basic styling cues reminiscent of Netflix.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Prerequisites:**
    - A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)
    - Basic familiarity with HTML and CSS

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aishwarya-KB-Gowda/Bharat_intern_task2.git
   ```

3. **Open the Files:**
   Open `index.html` and `style.css` in your preferred editor.

4. **View the Homepage:**
   Open `index.html` in your web browser. You may need to run a local server using tools like `python -m http.server` to view it locally.

**Customization:**

- Experiment with CSS properties to further enhance the visual style.
- Consider adding content placeholders (e.g., movie titles, images) to make it more visually appealing.
- Explore responsive design techniques to ensure it adapts to different screen sizes.

**Disclaimer:**

This project is purely for educational purposes and does not replicate Netflix's full functionality. It's recommended to explore JavaScript and frameworks like React for more advanced web application development.
